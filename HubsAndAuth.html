We defined these games as Authorities and the crawler saved them for us in a table in a csv file (attached in the submission). Of these, we chose 10 pages: 4 category pages (hubs) and 6 game pages (authorities) and performed a pageRank calculation based on the formula we learned in class:

                            <img src="images/RankFormula.png">
                            <br>
                            <u>In our context:</u><br>
                            We neglected 'd'.<br>
                            N equals 10 pages.<br>
                            I(p) represents a set of categories that point to p (game).<br>
                            D(j) represents a set of games that category j points to.<br>
                            <br>
                            <u>First step:</u><br>
                            At startup each page gets a rating of 1/10.<br>
                            <br>
                            <u>Second step:</u><br>
                            Understanding how the ranking of each page is calculated based on the pages that point to it.<br>
                            • Since category pages only point to other pages (game pages) and no one points to them then their rating will remain 1/10.<br>
                            • The game pages receive referrals from several different categories, so it was necessary to calculate each one independently.<br>

                                And shared that he especially enjoys games like "The Elder Scrolls® Online" and "Baldur's Gate 3." He felt that these games were highly rated
                                in the adventure category, because they provide the typical experiences of the genre. However,
                                The user indicated a specific lack of attraction to the game "Once Human". He stated that this game is not considered a traditional adventure game in his eyes. He recommended that this game should be rated lower or even
                                will be removed from the adventure category. The user emphasized a preference to see more classic adventure games,
                                such as "Grand Theft Auto V"
                                and "The First Descendant".

                                The second user recently started playing "Baldur's Gate 3" and was very impressed with its placement in the RPG and strategy categories. He emphasized the game's strategic depth, which aligns well with his gaming preferences. In addition, he has expressed great interest in online games, making games like "The Elder Scrolls® Online" and "Destiny 2" particularly relevant to his taste. The user was satisfied
                                also from the rating of "The Elder Scrolls® Online". The user also stated that the game "Once Human" is not particularly his favorite and therefore was rated lower compared to other games.

            <p>In this exersize, we created a Python script that retrieves the top 10 games from Steam across six different categories: Action, Adventure, RPG, Strategy, Indie, and Casual. The script saves the game data into a CSV file and generates individual graph visualizations for each category.
